This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The problem arises when the barcode scanner continuously fires the `onBarCodeScanned` callback multiple times for the same barcode, even after the barcode has been processed. This leads to duplicated data or unwanted repeated actions. The root cause is unclear and likely involves race conditions or unhandled events within the Expo Camera API.
